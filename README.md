  Why Sentiment Analysis ?
 
 Millions of messages are appearing daily in popular web-sites that provide services for microblogging such as Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook. Authors of those messages write about their life, share opinions on variety of topics and discuss current issues. Because of a free format of messages and an easy accessibility
of microblogging platforms, Internet users tend to shift from traditional communication tools (such as traditional blogs or mails) to microblogging services. As more and more users post about products and services they use, or express their political and religious views, microblogging web-sites become valuable sources of people’s opinions and sentiments. Such data can be efficiently used
for marketing or social studies.

perceived by community online.

from public. For example, “If this is the state, how do
you expect truth to come out? The MP who is
investigating 2g scam himself is deeply corrupt.”.

government.
